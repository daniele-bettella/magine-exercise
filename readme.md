# Backend Refactoring Exercise

This project contains a service for storing and retrieving phone numbers for users.

The code for the service has deliberately been written poorly.

The purpose of this exercise is to:

- understand the code,
- spot any potential bugs or issues,
- suggest refactorings to make the code more readable and maintainable,
- mention what's missing, assuming the service is to be run in production.

In preparation for the interview, we would like you to write down a list of issues, refactorings, etc. to be discussed during the interview.

Optionally, if you'd like to, you can also implement some of the suggestions and bring along the refactored solution. The service uses the [finagle](https://twitter.github.io/finagle/) and [json4s](http://json4s.org/) libraries, but feel free to replace them with other libraries, and use other libraries as you see fit.
